'''
The string method split takes a string and splits it into a list of strings. e.g.
>>> line = "This is all too easy"
>>> line.split(" ")
['This', 'is', 'all', 'too', 'easy']
	Write a program without using the split method that gets a line of text from the user and splits it into a list of strings
